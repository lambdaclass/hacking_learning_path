- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

## AWS tools

- EC2: A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- AMI: Amazon Machine Images is "An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance".
- ECS:  "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service.

# Installing Erlang and Elixir

- On Mac distributions, you can just `brew install erlang` to get the latest installation. In case of needing an specific version you can use asdf and install with `asdf install erlang [VERSION_DESIRED]`.

- Same can be achieved with Elixir through the same means `brew install elixir` for latest version, use asdf fo specific version.

- For other distributions, check [here](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/introduction) for Erlang and [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#distributions) for Elixir.

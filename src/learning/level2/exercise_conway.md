# Excercise: Conway's Game of Life
*Estimate time: 3-5 hours*

Implement a Conway's Game of Life using Rust + Wasm.

We suggest you to:

- Use the macroquad crate
- Do not follow the tutorial from section 4 of [Introduction to Rust+Wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/) (read only 4.3 because the rules are better explained there than on Wikipedia)

and here are some sources you might find useful in this journey:

- [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- [Rust+Wasm Unofficial Book *(1 to 3 & 4.3)*](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)
- [Macroquad crate](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad)
- [Wasm bindgen (*Optional*)](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/)

Before you embark on your Git journey, it is important to learn what an SSH Key (Secure Shell Key) is and how to generate one and add it to your GitHub account. This key will allow you to connect and authenticate to remote servers and services using the SSH protocol. With it you will be able to connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token each time.

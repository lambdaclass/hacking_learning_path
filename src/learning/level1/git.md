# Git

*Estimate reading time: 7-8 hours*

**No one** should merge his/her own PR without it being reviewed and approved from a co-worker and/or a client.

*Note: commit and **push** every day. Don't expect something perfect, go for the concrete. In one way or another, it's very likely that you will have to iterate later about that work done. Also, since that work isn't only stored on your computer, it won't be lost.*

## Note on Newlines at end of file
It is considered good style - and sometimes a necessity - to always end files with a newline (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline) and [here](https://gist.github.com/camh-/1bebfcff1b0f814e9b191edc60d5206b)). Make sure your editor of choice is correctly configured to add them automatically.

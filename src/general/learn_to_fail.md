# Learn to fail

As with most project making mistakes fast and loud will make you learn faster, so you should not be ashamed to work directly on a repository through Pull Request rather than workshopping in a draft made elsewhere

- **Avoid docs**. Work directly with Git, it will help get more eyes on your work to get corrections earlier.
- **Default to git**. As said earlier, Git snapshots your work and makes it more accessible to the public, more eyes means more people eager to help you

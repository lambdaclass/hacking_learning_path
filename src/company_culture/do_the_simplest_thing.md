# Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
Strive for solving problems in the simplest way possible. In order to achieve this, you first need to figure out a handful of ways to confront the issue at hand, and only then pick the one you consider that will work in the fewest, tiniest steps. Afterwards, refactor. Tomorrow’s code may need to be more complex, so do everything in your power to facilitate tomorrow’s code being as simple as possible. Also, while you shouldn't be blind to the future, avoid investing time and effort into developing features that are not currently necessary and might be a waste.

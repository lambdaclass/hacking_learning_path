At Lambda We won't micromanage you because we don't want to: **we give flexibility but ask for responsibility in exchange**.
Of course you can have days off to study or if you feel sick, but you can also have days off if you feel brain fog, nervous or a bit under the weather; we actually prefer it that way.

If you feel healthy and are comfortable, you will be able to solve more efficiently the problems you have in front of you. And even better, you will contribute to a healthier workspace.

Nobody wants to give up, that's a common emotion. The good news is that you are not giving up, you are getting to know yourself better, so you can recharge energies and keep learning and improving. In turn, when you are working we expect you to hit goals, be proactive and be a valuable member of the team.

There are three key elements we want you to have present at every moment: *Communication, Accountability and Empathy*.

- **Communication** is a key aspect for every human relationship. If you can measure your words to give a positive clear message, you can achieve anything in life through teamwork. Try labeling your emotions before communicating, since it is likely that people in front of you do not know what is going through your head. Also, be transparent but assertive if you disagree about something, it will help understand your point of view. Finally, try to avoid direct messages, working on channels allows more people to be on the loop and better feedback can be given.
- **Accountability**. Everyone makes mistakes, learners do something about them. If you get something wrong, communicate poorly or even feel overwhelmed about a situation, raise your hand and say it. It's very likely that a process failed, not you. Many people will be there to help you sort the issue, and you will surely learn something along the way. If you keep quiet and don't say anything you will regret it later when the truth burst through another hole.
- About **empathy**, we are all human beings and have complex emotions, if you are feeling great, it doesn't mean your colleague isn't feeling like shit. Perhaps your coworkers don't feel comfortable talking about emotions, so go talk with them and help them. You can talk to them or to their manager if you feel something is going on with them. There is a time when everybody feels weak and needs someone else for support. So be a hero, be empathic.

If you are reading this, you are probably giving your first -or second- steps on the long journey towards being a good developer, but first try to be a good human being and you will see how far that can get you.

# Python

- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is your bible.
- Use Python 3 in greenfield projects.
- Strive to migrate to Python 3 in non greenfield projects.
- Read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe/41573588#41573588) to understand environment hell in Python.
- Use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to escape from environment hell in Python. You can even do this locally in projects that are set up to use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.
- If you also need to stick with a specific minor version of Python (e.g. Python 2.7.14) you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) in combination with pipenv.

# Open source projects

- Suggested reading: [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html).
- Use MIT license.
- Fill the description field at the top of the repo page.
- Write a decent README.
- A good readme starts with a succinct description (one or two sentences) and, when possible, a very short and illustrative example use. The rest of the details go after this header.
- Use continuous integration, most likely travis.org.
- Make a good balance of features vs maintenance. Maintenance details usually matter more than adding a lot of features.

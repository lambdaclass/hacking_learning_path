# GitHub & GitLab

- If you are new to GitHub, you can put your hands on with [this course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- Progress in any project must be pushed every day. This must be done within a branch of the master repository and a Pull Request (PR) must be opened for reviewing the code, previous to merging the branch to master.
- Doc files should always be added via pull request.
  - Be sure those files are written in Markdown. 
  - We always use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/README) for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, graphs, etc.
- Never push to master directly, and only reviewers can merge branches to master.
